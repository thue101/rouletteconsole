##### **Roulette Console**
Roulette is a popular casino game. The aim of the exercise is to create a simple command line multiplayer version of the game.
On start-up, load a file which contains a list of player's names: Tiki_Monk and Barbara.

The application should support multiple bets from the same user within a round. Every 30 seconds the game should choose a random number between 0 and 36 (inclusive) for the ball to land on.

If the number is 1-36 then any bet on that number wins, and the player wins 36x the bet's amount. If the number is even, any bet on EVEN wins, and the player wins 2x the bet's amount. If the number is odd, any bet on ODD wins, and the player wins 2x the bet's amount. All other bets lose
